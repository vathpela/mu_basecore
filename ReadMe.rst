2102_RefBoot Changes
--------------------

- VariablePolicy has changed significantly since release/202008
    - The previously Mu-only infrastructure has been ported upstream, and the changes made with the community
      require attention on the platform side
    - MdeModulePkg/Library/UefiVariablePolicyLib/UefiVariablePolicyLib.inf becomes
      MdeModulePkg/Library/VariablePolicyLib/VariablePolicyLib.inf or MdeModulePkg/Library/VariablePolicyLib/VariablePolicyLibRuntimeDxe.inf
      and the class changes
    - MdeModulePkg/Library/MuVariablePolicyHelperLib/MuVariablePolicyHelperLib.inf becomes
      MdeModulePkg/Library/VariablePolicyHelperLib/VariablePolicyHelperLib.inf and the
      class changes
    - MdeModulePkg/Universal/Variable/UefiVariablePolicy/Library/VarCheckPolicyLib/VarCheckPolicyLib.inf moved to
      MdeModulePkg/Library/VarCheckPolicyLib/VarCheckPolicyLib.inf
    - MdeModulePkg/Universal/Variable/UefiVariablePolicy/Dxe/VariablePolicyDxe.inf is no longer needed. It is
      now built-in to Variable Services
    - All references to gVariablePolicyProtocolGuid and VARIABLE_POLICY_PROTOCOL are now gEdkiiVariablePolicyProtocolGuid
      and EDKII_VARIABLE_POLICY_PROTOCOL, respectively
- An instance of MmUnblockMemoryLib must be added to support the StandaloneMm changes. If your platform does not
  already support StandaloneMm, you should be safe to use MdePkg/Library/MmUnblockMemoryLib/MmUnblockMemoryLibNull.inf
- An instance of HttpIoLib is required if using NetworkPkg\HttpBootDxe\HttpBootDxe.inf
    - If in doubt, NetworkPkg/Library/DxeHttpIoLib/DxeHttpIoLib.inf looks like a safe choice
- A number of spelling fixes landed in SMBIOS. These will need to be fixed in the source
- `PcdSet*()` functions have been deprecated in favor of their `*S()` counterparts. Will need to update and check statuses
    - EX: `PcdSetBool()` becomes `Status = PcdSetBoolS()`
- A number of string functions (e.g. `UnicodeStrToAsciiStrS()`) have been deprecated in favor of their secure counterparts
    - EX: `UnicodeStrToAsciiStr()` becomes `UnicodeStrToAsciiStrS()` and an upper bound must be provided

2102_CIBuild Changes
--------------------

- MdeModulePkg/Universal/Variable/RuntimeDxe/PropertyBasedVarLockLib.inf is gone
    - This was not kept in the EDK2 integration. It is not required (and not supported).
- SecurityPkg/RandomNumberGenerator/RngDxeLib/RngDxeLib.inf is dropped in favor of EDK2 version.
    - Please use MdePkg/Library/DxeRngLib/DxeRngLib.inf.

2102_Rebase Changes
-------------------

| Starting commit: 150d5933348478cc97ea44221a1764f372fa61a6 (revised 202008 commit)
| Destination Commit from upstream edk2: edd46cd407ea4a0adaa8d6ca86f550c2a4d5c507 (tag: NONE - commit post 202102 tag)

* Add a AcquireLockOnlyAtBootTime() to VariablePolicySmmDxe.c
    - Open a bug for this.
* Make sure that it still makes sense to keep the SMM_VARIABLE_FUNCTION_LOCK_VARIABLE interface open.
    - Is there still a late-lock whitelist?
    - Probably should keep this change since, ultimately, the VarPolicy will disable locking.
    - Upstream it as a Bugzilla that will go away when VarLock is dropped, anyway.
* 542d38fdeb ("Revert "CHERRY-PICK: MdeModulePkg/SetupBrowserDxe: Fix IsZeroGuid() ASSERT."", 2020-03-23)
    - Dropping this commit. Believe it's a bad vestige of a bad CHERRY-PICK that was reverted.

Remaining to address from 202008:

* 8238a66de4 ("Update for VS2017", 2018-01-22)
    - Might try to drop this and see if it's still a problem for VS2017, otherwise upstream.
* 164b09676a ("REBASE: Revert "MdePkg: Added header file for Delayed Dispatch PPI"", 2020-06-17)
    - This should go away within this integration
